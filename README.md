Project brief (Source:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Structuring_a_page_of_content)
For this project, your task is to take the content for the homepage of a bird watching website and add structural elements to it so it can have a page layout applied to it. It needs to have:

A header spanning the full width of the site containing the main title for the page, the site logo, and the navigation menu. The title and logo appear side by side once styling is applied, and the navigation appears below those two items.
A main content area containing two columns — a main block to contain the welcome text, and a sidebar to contain image thumbnails.
A footer containing copyright information and credits.
You need to add a suitable wrapper for:

The header
The navigation menu
The main content
The welcome text
The image sidebar
The footer
You should also:

Apply the provided CSS to the page by adding another <link> element just below the existing one provided at the start.
Hints and tips
Use the W3C HTML validator to validate your HTML; you'll get bonus points if it validates as much as possible (the "googleapis" line is a line used to import custom fonts into the page from the Google Fonts service; it doesn't validate, so don't worry about it.)
You don't need to know any CSS to do this assessment; you just need to put the provided CSS inside an HTML element.
The provided CSS is designed so that when the correct structural elements are added to the markup, they will appear green in the rendered page.
If you are getting stuck and can't envisage what elements to put where, it often helps to draw out a simple block diagram of the page layout, and write on the elements you think should wrap each block.
Example
The following screenshot shows an example of what the letter might look like after being marked up.

The finished example for the assessment; a simple webpage about birdwatching, including a heading of "Birdwatching", bird photos, and a welcome message

Assessment
If you are following this assessment as part of an organized course, you should be able to give your work to your teacher/mentor for marking. If you are self-learning, then you can get the marking guide fairly easily by asking on the dev-mdc mailing list, or in the #mdn IRC channel on Mozilla IRC. Try the exercise first — there is nothing to be gained by cheating!
